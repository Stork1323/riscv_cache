*** SIMPLE CACHE ***

    - Direct-mapped cache 
    - Write-back using write allocate
    - Block size is four word (16 bytes or 128 bits)
    - Cache size is 16KiB, so it holds 1024 blocks
    - 32-bit address
    - The cache includes a valid bit and dirty bit per block 

    ===>

    - Cache index is 10 bits
    - Block offset is 4 bits
    - Tag size is 32 - (10 + 4) = 18 bits

The signals between the processor to the cache are:
    - 1-bit Read or Write signal
    - 1-bit Valid signal, saying whether there is a cache operation or not
    - 32-bit address 
    - 32-bit data from cache to processor 
    - 32-bit data from processor to cache
    - 1-bit Ready signal, saying the cache operation is complete

The interface between the memory and the cache has same fields as between the processor and the cache,
except that the data fields are now 128 bits wide. Here are the signals:
    - 1-bit Read or Write signal
    - 1-bit Valid signal, saying whether there is a memory operation or not
    - 32-bit address 
    - 128-bit data from cache to memory 
    - 128-bit data from memory to cache
    - 1-bit Ready signal, saying the memory operation is complete
